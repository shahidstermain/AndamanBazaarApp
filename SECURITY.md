## Known Issues Fixed in This PR

### 🔴 HIGH — Secrets Detected

| File | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `.idx/mcp.json` | Hardcoded Hostinger API token (Base64 high entropy string) | ✅ Fixed — replaced with `${input:api_token}` prompt variable |
| `.vscode/settings.json` | Embedded OpenSSH private key | ✅ Fixed — replaced with local path `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` |
| `ghdeploykey` | SSH deploy private key committed to repo | ✅ Resolved — file removed, patterns added to `.gitignore` |

> ⚠️ **Action required**: Since these keys were committed to git history, you **must** rotate/revoke them immediately even though the files have been cleaned up:
> - Revoke the Hostinger API token from your Hostinger dashboard
> - Revoke the SSH deploy key from your server/cPanel authorized_keys
> - Generate a new deploy key and store it only as a GitHub Actions secret

### 🟡 MEDIUM — CI Workflow Over-Privileged

| File | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Top-level `permissions: write-all` (implicit default) | ✅ Fixed — restricted to `contents: read, packages: read` |

### 🟠 HIGH — Vulnerable Dependencies (SCA)

| Package | Version | CVEs | Fixed Version | Status |
|---------|---------|------|--------------|--------|
| `happy-dom` | 12.10.3 | CVE-2025-61927 (Critical), CVE-2024-51757 (Critical) | 20.0.0 | ✅ Upgraded |
| `fastify` | 4.26.1 | CVE-2026-25224 (High 7.5), CVE-2026-25223 (Low 3.7) | 5.7.3 | ⚠️ Upgrade in `supabase/functions/` package.json |

### 🟡 LOW — Dockerfile Security

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Container running as root (no USER directive) | ✅ Fixed — added `appuser` non-root user |
| No HEALTHCHECK instruction | ✅ Fixed — added `wget`-based health check |

### 🔵 LOW — Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)

27 stitch HTML prototype files are missing `integrity` attributes on externally-hosted `<script>` and `<link>` tags (CWE-353). These are design mockups, not production code, but should be addressed:

**Quick fix** — add `integrity` and `crossorigin` to every CDN tag:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script
  src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"
  integrity="sha384-<hash>"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

### 🟡 MEDIUM — Highly Complex Functions

| File | Maintainability Index | Action |
|------|-----------------------|--------|
| `src/pages/AuthView.tsx` | 24 | Decompose into sub-components |
| `src/lib/postAdUtils.ts` → `saveDraft` | 20 | Extract upload, validation, DB steps into separate functions |
| `src/lib/security.ts` | 18 | Split into focused utility modules |
| `supabase/functions/generate-invoice/index.ts` | 17 | Add early-return guards, extract helpers |
| `supabase/functions/cashfree-webhook/index.ts` | 26 | Extract payment verification logic |

### 🔵 LOW — Duplicate Code (19,517 duplicated lines)

119 duplicate code groups were identified, mostly in `stitch/` HTML prototype files (expected) and test files. The actionable items:

- **`tailwind.config.js`** — consolidate duplicate theme extension blocks (Groups 9–11)
- **`tests/e2e/`** — extract shared Playwright setup/teardown into `tests/fixtures/` (Groups 1–5)
- **`src/pages/Home.tsx`** — extract repeated card component (Group 6)
- **`src/pages/ContactUs.tsx` / `About.tsx`** — share a `PageHeader` component (Group 7)
- **`src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx` / `TermsOfService.tsx`** — share a `LegalPage` wrapper (Group 8)

### 🔵 LOW — Dead Code (18 instances)
